# Selenium Experiment

A simple setup for experimenting with Selenium in node.js for browser automation.


### Getting Started

1. Clone or fork this repo.
2. Run `npm install` to download dependencies.


### Test 1: from MDN
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Your_own_automation_environment

- I used npm browser drivers instead of installing chromedriver onto the system path
- I had much better luck with chromedriver than geckodriver
- adding them to $PATH will eventually make more sense if we start to use this tool more regularly. For now I erred towards portability.
- test1.js is from this article


### Test 2: from Selenium JS API documentation
seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript
